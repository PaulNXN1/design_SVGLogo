## Description
This is the UPenn Module 10 Assignment.  The student was tasked to create a program with user prompts **[using node.js and NPM inquirer]** in order to create a resulting .svg file.  Additionally, the use of classes and constructors were used from the Week 10 learning focus points.  Module 10 from UPenn dealt with Object Oriented Programming.  


## Code Contributors
The project was completed by Paul Nixon, student. No group work was completed.

A powerpoint was first created, followed by a video of that presentation in order to successfully upload a video of multiple programs.  


## User Story
There was no pre-written code provide.   The main goal was to implement and practice the use of node.js and inquirer, which will be used to take data inputted by the user to create the .svg file.  This is a command-line application.  


## Acceptance Criteria
The assignment is complete when all aspects of the UPENN Module #10 Acceptance Criteria points are met.
