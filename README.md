## Description
This is the UPenn Module 10 Assignment.  The student was tasked to create a program with user prompts **[using node.js and NPM inquirer]** in order to create a resulting .svg file.  Additionally, the use of classes and constructors were used from the Week 10 learning focus points in order to have each shape [circle, square, or triangle] pull from the parent class, Shape.  Module 10 from UPenn dealt with Object Oriented Programming.  

The final portion of the assignment had the student create a **test** with JEST.  
The specific test code create will run verifying, or test that each shape will render a circle, square, or triangle method.  


The result can be seen in the video attached.  


## Code Contributors
The project was completed by Paul Nixon, student. No group work was completed.

JavaScript was the programming language.  Node.JS and JEST were used to execute the program.   


## User Story
There was no pre-written code provide.   The main goal was to implement and practice the use of node.js, inquirer and jest, which will be used to take data inputted by the user in order to create an example .svg file, which will be called "example.SVG.svg.  This is a command-line application.  

In summation, the tasks were as follows:

-  Write code for three shapes to pull from a parent class
- Create a render function that results from user imprompts running with inquirer 
-  Display a resulting SVG based on the user's submission(s)
- Code a test code and run **JEST**.  


## Acceptance Criteria
The assignment is complete when all aspects of the UPENN Module #10 Acceptance Criteria points are met.
